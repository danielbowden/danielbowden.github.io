# danielbowden.com.au

Source for my Jekyll powered personal portfolio.

Hosted on GitHub-Pages, it is generated by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site. The live site is available at [danielbowden.com.au](http://www.danielbowden.com.au).

## Installation

To run locally:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:danielbowden/danielbowden.github.io

bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve

```

Until github-pages supports Jekyll 2.0+ sass will need to be compiled separately

```shell
sass --update assets/styles/:assets/css/
```
