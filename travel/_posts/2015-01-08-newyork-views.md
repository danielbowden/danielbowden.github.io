Heading to the viewing decks at the top of the Rockefeller building was always high on our list of things we wanted to do. It was extremely cold and windy up there but the 360ยบ view was well worth it. It was a great spot to get your bearings for the layout of Manhatten and beyond as well as grasp just how big Central Park is.

One of the other "go to" attractions is to see a musical on Broadway. Not being the artsy, theatre types we were lucky to find the new Disney's Aladdin was showing while we were there and we figured we would enjoy that more given we had grown up with Aladdin and already knew the story. The show was fantastic and I was impressed by the quality and detail of the stage props and costumes as well as the way Genie came spinning in and out of the stage floor.

The following day we visited [High Line Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line_(New_York_City)) in the Chelsea neighbourhood. It is a 2.3km park in the middle of Manhattan built on an elevated disused railway line and was one of the highlights of the trip for me. We walked along in the winter sun and took photos before making our way into Chelsea Market to take advantage of the many quality food stalls inside.

We finished up this big day of walking with seeing the New York Knicks play the Houston Rockets at Madison Square Garden. Whilst it was a pretty substandard game of basketball it was good to see a game live in this iconic stadium.
