On the way to the Yankee Stadium tour, we stopped for breakfast at [Tom's Restaurant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom's_Restaurant), a place that needs no introduction. Cutting it fine to make it to the stadium in time by public transport we jumped in a taxi to get to our booked tour.

Being winter the baseball field looked very different to game day and was also covered in snow! Despite the weather, and not supporting the Yankees ([Go Giants](http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com)), the tour and franchise history were interesting and the guide very knowledgeable.

Hotdogs for lunch from a [popular spot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray's_Papaya) and later we made our way over to New Jersey for the Ice Hockey, a good local derby between the New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils. The atmosphere at the game was great and to make things better it was a close game that ended up going to overtime. The final result being 3-2 to the Islanders.
