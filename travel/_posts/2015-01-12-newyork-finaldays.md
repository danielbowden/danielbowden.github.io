With the sun out we took off to walk across Brooklyn Bridge and check out the other side of the East River. It was an easy walk and great to be able to look back at Manhattan from the bridge.

Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side is [Grimaldi's](http://www.grimaldis-pizza.com/home), the number 1 rated Pizzeria in New York. Apparently there would normally be up to an hour wait but we got in right away. It lived up to the reviews and was the best pizza we both had eaten the entire trip.

Brooklyn flea markets also happened to be on this day which was good to wander around and see all local artists and designers selling their goods as well as sample the great quality food stalls.

At the risk of making it sound like our whole days revolved around food, the following day we went down to the Lower East Side and stopped in at another place that had been on our list to visit. [Katz's Delicatessen](http://katzsdelicatessen.com) has been pictured in several [movies and tv shows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz's_Delicatessen#In_popular_culture) and is most famous for their huge pastrami sandwiches. Of course we polished off one each.

That night we sat at a rooftop bar in Manhattan having a few drinks under the heaters and blankets with a great view of the Empire State Building.

Our last day in NYC was a wet one and with our to do list complete we sat in the audience for a filming of the Late Show with David Letterman. It was as lame and unfunny as expected by it was good to see how a TV show is put together.

Our flight home was a long one, New York → Dubai → Sydney, but its not all bad as I'm only home for 9 days before its back on a plane again. This time to Japan!
