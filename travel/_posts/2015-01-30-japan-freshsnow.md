A decent overnight snowfall saw me get the GoPro out for a bit of video. I've quickly put together some short clips of the other day over in Strawberry Fields, at the Hanazono Resort.

I hope to create more short videos on this trip as it will be easier and less time consuming than sifting through hours of footage at the end to make a long video. In the past I've planned to make trip videos as well and I just never found the time and given with this trip I'll be continuing through the year I definitely won't have time.

I love Japanese food and especially [Okonomiyaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki). There is a restaurant in Hirafu called Kabuki 1 where you can make your own on the hotplate right in front of you. It's a good filling meal and when topped with a Sapporo beer it makes the perfect after snow dinner.
