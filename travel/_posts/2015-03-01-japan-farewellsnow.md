That last five weeks in Niseko went fast, too fast! I hope that the rest of my trip does not go that quickly. I've had the last week and half to myself after James went back home and have kept busy with most days spent on snow.

I gave the legs a good workout and hiked with my board to the peak of Mt Annupuri (1308m altitude) for a great 360º view of the surrounding mountains all the way to the ocean. A sat up there for at least half an hour resting, having a drink and a snack and just admiring the view.

I visited the onsen one night to give the muscles a good soak in the hot water. Nothing says Japan like sharing a soak in the onsen with 50+ of your closest naked Japanese men after a big day on the mountain.

On my second last day I went back to Moiwa and managed to have the resort pretty much to myself. So much so that the lift operator was waiting for me to come down again as I was the last person he had seen since I last went up.

On my last snow day it was knee deep snow and I had until midday until I needed to come in and pack all my snow gear and warm clothes ready for a courier to come pick them up and ship them home. I won't be needing them on my trip after this and from here the weather should *hopefully* only get warmer. I've had some incredible snow in Japan and I'll definitely be back. Now on to the next stop, I'm currently flying Sapporo → Tokyo → Seattle (USA).
