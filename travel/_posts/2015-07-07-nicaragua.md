After a long bus journey with two border crossings in one day we had made it through Honduras and into Nicaragua, rolling into the outskirts of Leon just as the sun had gone down. Being the forward thinking planners that we are lately, we had no accommodation booked and waved down a taxi to take us into the middle of town. Our first attempt at a hostel was met with rejection as they were full so instead we had to walk around Leon in the dark carrying our bags and deciphering Spanish instructions from locals in the street as to where to find the next hostel we had in mind.

The next morning we set off to explore and find breakfast. Stopping in at the local markets we found a friendly lady selling street food cooked on a small coal fire at sat down at her two seat table area for a plate of tasty grilled chicken with rice and salad. By mid morning Leon was already unbearably hot with the humidity making walking around even harder. We took refuge from the heat in a smoothie shop for cheap ~$2 smoothies, a refreshing treat that quickly became a regular habit throughout the country thanks to the cheap cost of living and desire to keep cool.

That night we made a last minute decision and took an old school bus to a beach party in Las Penitas. The rain didn't stop anyone and with the help of plenty of rums between us we danced outside by the sand until it was time to take the bus back to Leon, getting into bed around 3am. Volcano boarding was conveniently booked for early the next morning and whilst hiking a volcano hungover is not something I would recommend it was soon forgotten once we were getting to slide down it. We hiked up carrying our board, taking photos during rest stops along the way. Surprisingly, Cerro Negro is relatively new in volcano terms at 165 years, and there was no question it was still active as we felt the hot ground at the top and witnessed both smoke and sulphur smells coming from the holes in the crater. We got dressed into our full body orange jumpsuits and goggles and one by one slid down the volcano borderline out of control. I was down the bottom in no time with a head, mouth and face full of volcanic rocks and dirt but a smile on my face. I turned around to proudly watch Lauren come hurtling down the steep 41 degree slope straight after me and together we waited at the bottom on the black surface in the hot sun for the rest of the group to follow. The complimentary cold beer as we got back on the truck was very much appreciated and we were both pulling dirt and rocks out of our hair for hours afterwards.

Not content with ending to our volcano hiking careers at that point, especially after the overnight hike in [Guatemala](linkkk), we reluctantly signed up to hike the Telica volcano at sunset the very next day. We were happy to find out that no one else had signed up and it would just be us for a private tour. We took the 4WD from Leon to the base of the volcano stopping along the way for some photos. We met a local who was digging a well 40m deep with only a shovel for the families in the area so that they did not have to travel 1.5hrs each way by horse just to get water. We began ascending the volcano as our guide filled us in on its history on the way up. The most alarming yet exciting fact was that it had only erupted 10 days prior sending smoke and large (>100kg) rocks travelling through the air with some landing through the wall of a building 4kms away. In Australia they would never let you do something like hike to the top of an active volcano, and even if they did there would be a fence around the crater. However this is Central America and instead you can do this:

Bus crossing Honduras and into Nicaragua. 
First stop Leon. 
Hot!
Markets for breakfast. Tasty grilled chicken with rice and salad. 
Walk around, tried some fried cheese for free. 
Old school bus to Beach party in the night at las penitas. 
Hungover early morning to go volcano boarding. Hiked up the volcano taking photos at the rest stops along the way
Felt the hot ground at the top. Smoke and sulphur smell coming from holes in the crater. 
Got dressed into our full body orange jumpsuits and goggles. Took turns sliding down the volcano borderline out of control. Occasionally tapping feet on either side to keep straight. Down the bottom in no time with a head, mouth and face full of volcanic dirt but smile on my face. Turned around to proudly watch Lauren come hurtling down straight after me. 
It was good to go down at the start of the group and get away from the swarms of bees at the top, especially as in highly allergic to them. Waited at the bottom in the hot sun standing around on a hot black surface. The complimentary cold beer as we got back on the truck was very much appreciated. Pulling dirt and rocks out of my hair for hours. 
Telica volcano sunset hike. Ended up being a private tour. Took the 4wd from Leon to the base of the volcano stopping along the way for some photos and to talk to a local who was digging a well 40m deep with only a shovel for the families in the area so that they did not have to travel 1.5hrs each way by horse just to get water. 
Hiked the volcano as our guide filled us in on its history on the way up. The most alarming yet exciting fact was that it had only erupted 10 days prior sending smoke, lava? and large (>100kg) rocks travelling through the air with some landing through the wall of a building 4kms away. In Australia they would never let you do something like hike to the top of an active volcano, and even if they did there would be a fence around the crater. However this is Central America and instead you can do this:
%Photo peering over%
The crater was 700m in diameter and amazing to be standing there that close and alone on our own private volcano. We moved around to get photos from many different vantage points before sitting on a rock to watch the sun set over the many surrounding volcanoes and farmland. We descended in the dark each carrying small torches to help us hop between the sharp volcanic rocks. We arrived back into Leon by 9pm exhausted and got some quick dinner before laying around relaxing and unnecessarily causing our mums to worry back home by showing them on Facebook what we had just done.

The following day we we moving on to Surfing Turtle Lodge on the Pacific Coast. A hostel commonly referred to as the number one place to visit in Central America and also owned by our guide from our Mexico trip 18months earlier. 
Remote spot accessible by boat. 
Self sustainable with solar power, water tanks and a small garden providing much of the vegetables and eggs for the kitchen.
Perfect spot to relax and do as you please with most days typically involving any combination of swimming, hammocks, reading, table tennis, surfing, drinking and eating. It was so hot that you had to sprint across the dark sand taking refuge in the shady spots and ducking in and out of either the surf or the beach showers to keep cool. 
One activity I was certain not to miss was the daily late afternoon beach volleyball competitions which always had a large turnout and finished with a cool down swim watching the sun set over the water. 
Being such a small and remote spot created a social atmosphere and the evenings were usually spent making friends over drinking games before moving out to the late night beach bar and playing giant Jenga complete with entertaining and sometimes embarrassing rules for each piece. 

Transport to Little Corn consisted of firstly riding in the back of a horse and cart, then a boat, then a taxi, then a small propeller plane, then a taxi, then a boat, then walking.

Leon to Granada bus. We had jumped in a taxi straight off the flight and found the bus station. The bus was leaving straight away and no time to get any food or drink. Instead we bought a can of drink each and a chicken pastry out of a container some guy was selling walking down the aisle. In total it was all $1.50 and as an added bonus we didn't get food poisoning, in fact the pastry was pretty good. 

Granada watched a local softball game. Spectator entrance fee was 25c each. 

Took a boat around the islands in Granada. 

Early morning to catch a 6:30am public bus with all the locals going to work. At this stage, 6 months in, I barely know what work is anymore and instead we are heading south to the island of Ometape. Biggest lake in Central America?

All you can drink rum for $10 meant another hungover travel day on several forms of transport. 

Shared a taxi with a guy I met in the hostel. Clutch start the taxi. Driver didn't seem phased so we continued on to San Juan. 

Jumped off the bus too early to realise it was the wrong stop. Quickly jumped back on and sat down. Minutes later a guy came up to Lauren, "chicka, chicka" and was holding her wallet. She had dropped it outside somewhere. Everyone around us on the bus both local and foreigner gasped at how lucky she was that someone was nice enough to chase her down and give it back

Bus across border, attendant holding our passport writing on a legal document for customs border entry  that we are from Austria. When we questioned it he said Bueno same same. We just laughed and shrugged.
