The border crossing out of Costa Rica and into Panama was an unnecessarily painful yet typical experience for a Central American land border. We had young guys suspiciously herding us towards shops and trying to "help" with our bags as we got off the bus. After avoiding their assistance and making our own way to the most official looking building we could find in an area of dirt roads and stray dogs. We stood in the heat in line at immigration for a while only to learn that what the non-uniformed guy had been telling us was true and we did need to hand our passport over and pay an exit tax to a guy back in town in a shop that sold fried chicken and dodgy looking hotdogs in order to get a stamp and be allowed to leave. We crossed the bridge on foot with our bags on our backs and were now on the other side of the river and in a different country, though we far from finished with pointless processes.

In what seemed to be an exercise in both job creation and powertripping there were three different checkpoints before being allowed to officially enter Panama. Their request for proof of onward travel for each person threw us but my quick thinking to show a receipt email Lauren had forwarded me was enough to be allowed to pass, even though it had no names on it and three guys in front of us had just been rejected for having no proof. In another area we paid an entrance fee, though Lauren and I paid a different price despite it being to the same guy. With no distinct path or signs throughout the whole process it was on you to make sure you had the correct documentation and stamps before continuing to ensure you had no trouble in the future as you went to leave.

##Bocas Del Toro

We shared a van with some other tourists away from the border and a few hours south to the dock before all catching a boat together from the mainland to the islands of Bocas Del Toro. a ???.

We coincidentally met back up with the group on the wharf at the beach outside our hostel and went for a swim before watching the sunset and organising to meet up later for dinner and drinks.

We all took advantage of the cheap 2 for 1 drink special, overwhelming the girl behind the bar by each ordering multiple sets of two drinks rather than sharing the second one with a friend they expected us to do. Nightclub, Hungover

Playa Estrella (starfish beach)

Moved hostel to Aqua lounge. Swings, slack line, jumping platforms. 

Red frog beach. Sun came out, went swimming in the surf. First place in the Carribean we had been so far that had surf, not as protected/sheltered by the reef. Spotted a red frog.

That night our hostel held a big party. The group came over to join us. Another big night

Tour through the islands. Saw dolphins and sloths. Stopped for lunch at Zapatillas Island. Walked around the island taking photos. Moved on in the boat to another island where we snorkelled and tried out deep sea boarding.
