The border crossing out of Costa Rica and into Panama was an unnecessarily painful yet typical experience for a Central American land border. After avoiding the assistance of the young guys trying to "help" with our bags and lead us towards shops we made our own way to the most official looking building we could find in an area of dirt roads and stray dogs. We stood in the heat in line at immigration for a while only to learn that what the non-uniformed guys had been telling us was true and we did need to hand our passport over and pay an exit tax to a shop in the town that sold fried chicken and dodgy looking hotdogs in order to get a stamp and be allowed to leave. With our bags on our backs we walked across the border on foot, crossing a bridge over the river that divides the two countries. Now on the other side of the river we had exited Costa Rica, though we far from finished with pointless processes.

In what seemed to be an exercise in both job creation and powertripping there were three different checkpoints before being allowed to officially enter Panama. With no distinct path or signs throughout the whole process it was on you to make sure you had the correct documentation and stamps before continuing to ensure you had no trouble in the future when you went to leave. Their request for proof of onward travel for each person threw us but my quick thinking to show a receipt email Lauren had forwarded me was enough to be allowed to pass, even though it had no names on it and three guys in front of us had just been rejected for equally having no proof. Elsewhere in another unmarked area we were required to pay an entrance fee, though Lauren and I paid a different price despite it being to the same guy. Moving on, we filled out yet another form and finally we had reached the final level in what seemed like a frustrating game and were able to show our passports and be on our way.

##Bocas Del Toro

We shared a van with some other tourists away from the border and a few hours south to the dock before all catching a boat together from the mainland to the islands of Bocas Del Toro. a ???.

After checking in to our hostel and enjoying the air conditioning we coincidentally met back up with the group on the wharf at the beach and went for a swim before watching the sunset and organising to catch up later that night for dinner and drinks.

At dinner we all took advantage of the cheap 2 for 1 drink special, overwhelming the girl behind the bar by each ordering multiple sets of two drinks rather than sharing the second one with a friend like they expected us to do. Moving on to a nightclub in town we danced and drank on the deck hanging over the water until the early hours before finding some late night snacks and getting a taxi home.

Hungover and tired, Lauren and I surfaced late the next morning. We found a public bus and spent the rest of the day at Playa Estrella (starfish beach). We walked around to a quiet part on beach and had an area to ourselves to float around in the calm water for a couple of hours curing the hangovers and taking photos with the starfish. A couple had warned us they had only seen one starfish but I'm not sure what their problem was because in our area alone we spotted over twenty without really trying or venturing far from shore.

With a rainy day keeping us inside for most of a day and some flexibility in our schedule we decided to extend our stay and move over to another hostel, Aqua Lounge for another three nights. This hostel was on another nearby island and built completely over the water with pools cut in to the deck and swings, a slack line and jumping platforms all to jump off.

We took a boat over to another island to visit Red Frog beach and were lucky to have the sun and blue sky come out not long after getting there. I went for a swim in the surf, enjoying having both the warm water of the Caribbean and some decent waves as Bocas is not as sheltered by reef as some of our other stops in the Caribbean such as [Belize](linkk) and Little Corn Island ([Nicaragua](linkk)). We walked along the beach where the sand met the jungle in search of a red frog but being both unsure on their size and where to look we came up empty handed and a little disappointed. We stopped into a restaurant on the island for lunch and as luck would have it there was a frog right near the door step!

That night our hostel held a big party and with the others coming to join us we ended having a big group to have another big night of drinking and dancing thanks to Lauren taking advantage of the free drinks for ladies night and getting the both of us plenty of free rum. 

We took a boat trip for the day around the islands spotting dolphins and sloths along the way. By lunchtime the sun was out and we stopped at Zapatillas Island for some lunch, a swim and to explore the island. The final stop of the tour was yet another island for some snorkelling and deep sea boarding, an activity I had heard about and was very keen to try. It involved being towed behind the boat holding on to a clear perspex board and wearing the snorkelling goggles. By changing the angle of the board you could turn left or right as well and dive down under the water for as deep and as long as your breathe allowed before racing back to the surface. It wasn't long before I was doing multiple spiralling turns underwater as well as repeatedly equalising my ears to get deeper and deeper. Lauren surprised both myself and the guide and despite asking countless nervous questions beforehand she did really well, spending most of the time also playing around underwater instead of staying on the surface like many others.

##Lost and Found

Our next stop on our journey south was Lost and Found hostel, an ??ecological hostel in the middle of nowhere perched on a mountain with great views looking across the valley. The remoteness of
