The bag check at the Colombian border involved putting our bags on the table opening the zipper and then closing it. Once again no X-ray machines in this part of the world and the carefree approach to inbound security further reinforced my assumption that no one smuggles anything *into* Colombia...

Our first stop off the boat was Capurgana, a small beachside town on the ??? north west Caribbean coast??. On arrival we were told "just swing by the office in town when you feel like it and get your passport stamped" and so we checked into a nearby hostel and after settling in wandered up the street for the 30 seconds of official business. That night we met up with our San Blas boat group for a farewell dinner and some drinks before saying our goodbyes only to realise the majority of the group would be heading in the same direction and we would see each other again. Early the following morning six of us from the tour met on the dock for the first boat out with plans to make the long trip to Cartagena in a day.

As recent as five years ago a tourist visiting Colombia was near unheard of. Bombs were exploding in the street, there were almost daily kidnappings, and its people were living in fear, afraid to go outside. Still trying to shake this bad image or stigma the country was now to be excused for not being as prepared for tourism in comparison to many other countries we had visited so far that have had much more time. There was little point getting frustrated at a slow moving line or unnecessary process for these matters will sort themselves out over time as more people visit and afterall, these days we rarely have anywhere to be in a hurry...

Planning this trip, Colombia had been a country we had contemplated skipping on our way through South America purely for its'?? bad reputation and safety concerns. However, as we made our way through Central America we were repeatedly told by fellow travellers heading in the opposite direction that it was a destination not to be missed. Much to our surprise we found a beautiful country full of diverse landscapes from Caribbean beaches to dense jungles, and mountainous coffee regions to sprawling modern cities. The people were friendly and helpful and were genuinely interested in talking to us, not because they wanted something but because they were excited to learn where we were from and proud that their country had come such a long way in a short amount of time with people now coming to visit. We had a man in the fruit market taking time out of his grocery shopping to explain the exotic fruits and even buying one for us to try, to people from the ticket office even coming out to find us at bus terminals so that they could make sure we got on the right bus. 

##Cartagena
Our first main stop was the ??old city of Cartagena, a historical ???. The temperature??. The city is surrounded by a wall that once protected it from pirates many years ago?? The streets were filled with flowers from overhanging balconies, and boutique clothing and jewellery shops. The numerous town squares were always filled with people, both local and tourists, enjoying a drink or food together whilst listening to nearby music.

We spent a day at nearby Playa Blanca, a ??tropical white sand beach?? on the Caribbean coast with warm blue water. Oblivious to the days of the week, we made the mistake of going on the Sunday of a public holiday weekend and found the beach packed with locals arriving by the bus load to escape the heat. We walked further up and before long we were enjoying Piña Coladas inside pineapples on a quieter part of the beach whilst floating around in the water.

With the majority of the group from the boat trip now in town we met up one night and walked around the old city together buying cheap drinks from the street vendors. They were so frequent that you could just buy single beers knowing there will be another guy selling cold ones out of an eski as soon as you finish the previous one.

???, also known as the mud volcano, is a strange yet entertaining day trip outside of Cartagena and involves soaking in the mud inside a ????m volcano crater. The volcanic mud is claimed to have health benefits, whether this is true or not we are unsure but we enjoyed the brief massages from the guys waiting inside and then floated around covered head to toe in mud. The density is hard to explain but as it was so deep you could not touch solid ground making it hard to stay upright. We constantly found our knees floating up to our chins or feet up behind our heads and had to frantically wave our arms about in the mud to keep balance. Upon getting out we were directed downhill to a nearby lake to wash off and were given thorough assistance from the local ladies who quickly had Lauren's top off followed by both our pants. Sitting naked in the water they washed our clothes as well as us and we walked away spotless and slightly violated.

##Taganga
Around six hours from Cartagena is Taganga a small seaside town that gave us easy access to nearby Tayrona National Park. We got up early and took off on a very hot two hour walk through the national park to ??El Cabo San Juan?? where we would be spending the night. We walked alongside the coast for the most part before taking a wrong turn and ending up taking the hot, dusty horse track for the rest of the way. It was puzzling to find the place so poorly signposted for a popular tourist spot as we came across several forks in the path, though as mentioned earlier this was not unusual for Colombia. On arrival we were rewarded by the inviting blue water that sparkled with glittery flecks of ???. We were teased with idea of swimming and relaxing on the beach by instead first having to endure the unnecessary process of queuing for a hammock to secure accommodation for that night. Having been prewarned of this we managed to be third in line and *only* had to wait 1.5 hours. The beach was worth it and we spend the rest of the day relaxing in the clear water and taking photos. That night we slept in hammocks, kept cool by the ocean breeze. We took our time slowly walking back and stopping for a swim or a photo at the beaches along the way as well as some fresh squeezed orange juice and seafood ceviche being sold at stalls along the path.

##Lost City Trek
A relatively unknown trek in comparison to the likes of Machu Picchu that sees X?? people a day/year, the 47km round trip Lost City Trek has a maximum 100 people allowed into the site a day and only ???? complete the trek a year. Lauren had heard from others that the trek was a must do and whilst I was not yet entirely convinced we took off anyway with the desire to see more of Colombia's untouched landscapes and experience part of the jungle that few get to see. We had been warned that it would be the *"sweatiest you have ever been"* and that there were lots of mosquitoes but we were mentally unprepared for what lie ahead walking straight up steep mountains and down the other side for four straight days in the heat and humidity of the jungle. We consider ourselves relatively fit and have done plenty of hikes before however it was quickly clear we might be in for something a bit harder when we arrived to see some friendly guys in our group, one wearing a past marathon shirt and another an iron man shirt and here I am wearing a beer singlet...

In 2003 hikers on the Lost City Trek were kidnapped by guerrilla groups and held hostage in the jungle for 3 months. These days there is strong military presence in the area carrying big guns and giving us reassuring waves.
After the first day of walking we were thrilled to get to the first camp. Exhausted, no one lasted much longer after dinner and all retired to our hammocks for the night knowing it would be an early start and lots more walking the next day. With our clothes smelling and drenched in sweat the best we could hope for was hanging them out overnight to dry and air out. Trouble is nothing dries overnight due to the humidity, if anything it gets wetter. 

The second day was tough for me after being up all night with a bad fever, shaking, dizziness and a pounding headache from suspected heatstroke. We walked in torrential rain for five straight hours, soaked through, with the slipperiness of the muddy hills and hopping between rocks made even harder by my lack of balance whilst sick. An hour from our next camp we came to a river crossing that was normally knee deep however because of the rain it was instead chest deep, fast flowing rapids. One by one we pulled ourselves along a rope strung across the river and made it to the other side, something that would never be allowed back home. 

Seven litres of water throughout the day and an early nights sleep in the hammocks meant I was feeling a lot better the following morning and ready to tackle the walk and 1200 step climb into the Lost City. ??Built by the ?? in ??, the Lost City is ??. We were fortunate to have blue sky and great visibility as we sat and admired the view, very satisfied that we had made it.

The walk home was completed in two big 7+ hour days back along the same way we had come in. Exhaustion, lots of sweat, and blisters followed us to the end and we were more than relieved to finally see the carpark at the finish. We passed clean, fresh faces on their way in and wished them luck just as other groups had done to us four days prior. If only their smiling faces knew what they were in for we thought as we joked at our cocky and confident we also must have looked to others when we first started. 

I will say though that despite the struggle detailed above it definitely gave us a sense of accomplishment. We pushed ourselves through some amazing landscapes, passed many local indigenous families living basic lives along the trail and made it to the remote site that is only accessible on foot and is something few people will ever see.

##Medellín
The city of Medellín was once known as the most violent city in the world, home to the notorious Pablo Escobar and the scene of constant brutal conflict between competing drug cartels as they terrorised the city and even the country. The city has since gone through tremendous transformation and was even recently chosen as the most innovative city in the world, outranking New York, as a result of its recent advances in politics, education and social development. The residents are proud of this progress and are enthusiastic about the benefits the newfound safety brings, not only to their everyday lives but in slowly rebuilding the country's image to the rest of the world.

```“What did your friends and family say when you said you were coming here?”```

Was the opening line from the ironically named Pablo, our guide for the free walking tour around the city. It was a question that was clear he had asked many times before and one that he already knew the answer to. We had heard and read many good things about the [Real City Walking Tour](http://www.realcitytours.com) and had chosen to reserve a spot on our first day as a great way to get familiar with the city and get a local perspective on the history of Medellín. Pablo is a passionate and knowledgeable guide and gave us an honest and informative background of a city with a very dark past. It was both alarming and fascinating to realise that the events that took place occurred in our lifetime and when he speaks about this era, you know he is talking about something he lived through himself.

Its encouraging to notice that our guide, along with many others that we met during our month long stay, have the foresight to realise that if they provide a memorable experience to visitors these people will go home with nothing but good memories and great things to say about Colombia. Pablo went as far as to say that even if one person in our group inspired a friend back home to visit Colombia then the country and its tourism industry has come a long way.

One part of travelling I find most enjoyable is trying all the various street food in each of the new countries. Colombian stalls appeared to take pride in deep frying as many different types of food as possible which meant that out of "convenience" empanadas became almost a daily snack for me. We also tried many other things from the deep fried selection including eggs, cheese and dough. Thankfully, Colombia wasn't just fried foods, it is home to many exotic fruits found only in this part of the world. Freshly made natural juices can be found all over the country often included with any meal or for cheap in the streets. We made a trip to the local fruit market, with a plan to buy any fruit we had never tried before. It wasn't your typical tourist attraction and as the only non-locals in the whole market we stood out more than usual but had a great time practicing our Spanish as we walked around asking about the fruits and ended up coming away with a full bag of unique pieces of fruit to try.

??Metro cable car. took train, then cable all the way up, took photos back down and train to home all for $0.88 AUD.??

I figured a trip to Medellín would not be complete without some insight into the life and times of one of the world's most well known and wealthiest criminals in history so we went on a private Pablo Escobar tour. The controversial tour is not advertised online as its not exactly legal and is a topic the government and most Colombian's would rather put behind them. We first visited Pablo's grave before our guide took the two of us to visit one of Pablo's many mansions. We followed a private driveway in the hills overlooking the city until our driver stopped at a large gate and beeped the horn. Inside and with the gate closed behind us we learned the house was attacked as recently as four years ago and could see it is riddled with bullet holes. A farm was also attacked under a month before in search of some the many millions of dollars buried around the country. As the only two on the tour it suddenly felt very real. Inside the house we were lucky to meet his brother Roberto, who was once one of the financial brains behind the Medellín cartel. I'm currently reading his book, [The Accountant's story](http://amzn.com/0446178926) and can't imagine the things this man has seen and done.

##Guatape

Guatape day trip. Rock. 740 steps. View
Colourful town
Ordered off the bus by a policeman holding an assault rifle because we weren't carrying our passports... Emptied the contents of our bag on the side of the road and tried to ask us questions. Sometimes it's better when you *can't* speak Spanish...
Cable car. Allows locals in the outer mountain suburbs to get to the city cheap
Fruit market. X number of exotic fruits exclusive to Colombia
Medellin rum

##Salento
Bus 6 hrs To Salento. Met up with friends. Long neck beer for $1.23 AUD. local rum

Coffee tour. Most surprising was that Colombia exports the majority of their coffee only keeping the lesser quality for their own consumption. A cup of coffee purchased in a cafe is not made with the good quality beans

Cocora valley. walked without seeing anyone for most of the day. Played silly buggers in the huge palm trees. 60m??

##Bogota
All day but nice bus with wifi, TVs in each seat. Near lie flat reclining seats.

Found our hostel and went out to grab some quick dinner and a beer after a tiring day of sitting. Beer cost $0.91 AUD!!!

Shopping to find Lauren a replacement camera. Not surprising the selection is lacking but after multiple shopping centres and a lot of charades we got one. As anyone who knows Lauren and her attachment to taking photos would know it was just as much a relief to me as it was her that she finally found a new camera... Maybe more

Graffiti tour bogota.
Something beautiful for tourists to associate with Colombia rather than the bad images of the past and show friends back home.
Most artists do not get paid but will often sell prints of their work.
City and building owners much more accepting and often a verbal agreement is enough from a homeowner to allow a wall size artwork to be painted.
Some artists have become commercially successful with one fence being appraised to be worth $10-15k if it were ever able to be sold.
Flown all over the world to do pieces of art.
Can now be painted in daylight without fear of prosecution resulting in higher quality pieces and public recognition without the need to hide behind a nickname/moniker.

turned out to be my most photographed place of the trip so far




as well as some of more natural options like fresh juice 

^^??
Early the following morning six of us from the tour met on the dock for the first boat out with plans to make the long trip to Cartagena in a day. The boat staff sat around talking and waited around for scheduled departure time to then start weighing all the bags slowly and packing them in the boat. An hour later we were off, on what ended up being a smooth and calm two hour boat trip. We landed in Turbo, a ugly transit town, in search of a bus to take us the rest of the way. Turns out finding a bus wasn't hard as everyone wanted to muscle their way onto the small dock to lead the overwhelmed tourists to the bus terminal for kickbacks from the driver.

??^^






so interesting that the history we were learning about happened during our lifetime and as recent as . most photos taken
