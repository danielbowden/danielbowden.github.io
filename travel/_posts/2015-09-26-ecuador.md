We opted to fly from Colombia into Ecuador, favouring the ??1hr?? flight into the capital, Quito, over the ~30hr bus alternative. Being right on the equator I had expected, perhaps naively, that Ecuador would be hot and humid. However Quito is the ??highest capital city in the world, sitting at XXXXm ?? and there was snow on the tops of the mountains. I had been wearing thongs, shorts, tshirts or singlets pretty much everyday for almost 6 months and now all of a sudden we had to put that stuff away and get out the warm clothes that had been packed away at the bottom of our backpacks.

We joined the free walking tour of Quito the following morning to help us get to know our way around the city. It started with a wander through the markets where we met the local ladies selling exotic fruits and vegetables and purchased a delicious fresh mora (mulberry) and coconut juice. We were then lead through the city by the friendly and knowledgeable local guide learning about its history as we visited its various plazas, churches and the main square.

The equator is not far from Quito, marking the middle of the world and the point where after spending the last ??seven months?? travelling within the Northern Hemisphere I would be crossing back into the same half of the world as Australia. In ??19XX?? the government built a monument to represent this landmark only for it to be later revealed, with the help of GPS equipment, that it was built in the wrong spot. To be fair, being XXm off was impressively close given the primitive measuring instruments of this time. Nevertheless, for the nearby property, and actual location of the equator, this was a gift dropped in their lap and they capitalised on this by turning the property into a tourist attraction. They named it ??? (Middle of the world) and set up various exhibitions to demonstrate the effects of the equator along with several 0ยบ 0' 0'' signs throughout complete with a "calculated with GPS" line below in what might be a subtle dig at the government's gaffe. ??Info about equator, earth bulge, gravity, balance, water spinning. We spent the afternoon taking photos and, like any normal person would do, jumping back and fourth between hemispheres.

Volcanic activity in the area. ??Biggest volcano in the world?? At risk of eruption and was sending smoke in to the air the whole time we were there.

Our last day in Quito was spent exploring the city. We climbed the small ladders to the top of the ?? cathedral for a better view of the city before visiting the XX church filled with ??gold. At lunchtime we headed to the markets, ordering a meal big enough to feed the both of us from local favourite ??Don Jimmys??. It included a huge amount of tasty Corvina fish, potatoes, rice, a bowl of ceviche and a bowl of popcorn for $X ??.

Late that afternoon we rode the Tereferico cable car, lifting us high into the mountains for a great view overlooking the city and the highest point of the trip so far at XXXXm. This put into perspective just how big the city of Quito is, home to XXXX people and extending as far as the eye can see in every direction.

##Galapagos Islands??

The Galapagos Islands had been one of the must do places from the start and the excitement only grew as we met people over the past months that had already been. ??Info on galapagos. Location, background, charles darwin, animals.

We flew out of Quito and after a short stop in Gyuaquil?? landed on the island of San Cristobal. Lauren had posted a photo of our boarding passes and entry permit on Facebook at the airport before boarding and by chance some friends we had made on our trip through the San Blas Islands happened to see it. They were just finishing up their stay in the Galapagos and had plenty of helpful info to share. Just as we had intended to do they had crammed as much as they could into their stay. With no accommodation booked we headed to their hostel and managed to get the same cheap rate they were paying. Back at sealevel we were back to boardshort weather and within an hour of landing we were already hanging out with sea lions on the beach of La Loberia.

Animals in the Galapagos do not see humans as a threat. Protected, predators, etc. As a result they are not scared.???

That first afternoon, on recommendation from the hostel owner, we walked to Tijeretas?? a quiet and protected bay with clean, clear water. We jumped in with snorkels and had been swimming for only a couple of minutes when I spotted a turtle and called Lauren over. We followed it until a playful sea lion pup found us and wanted our attention, so much so that it swam circles around the turtle until it went away. We were the only ones in the water and swam with it for over an hour. It was so curious coming right up to our faces before darting away encouraging us to follow. I dove down doing twists and backflips underwater as it copied me getting more and more excited the more I played with it. People were standing on the cliffs watching us, their attention drawn by the sound of Lauren squealing with excitement through her snorkel. It was getting dark and we were shivering so we reluctantly said goodbye to our little friend and got out of the water. Considering our plane had only landed at XXpm that afternoon we were already in love with the place and if the rest of our stay was even be half as exciting as that first afternoon we would've been happy.

##Banos

Taffy

Hot springs

mountain bikes along the route of waterfalls

Hired a buggy and drove manically around the town finding any patch of dirt I could. We explored the town and drove ?? clifftops without guard rails stopping to look down at the rivers and waterfalls far below. The highlight though was Lauren announcing:
`I'm turning the GoPro off, it encourages you to be silly`

As we got back to town and returned the buggy I looked at Lauren's face as she said `you almost made me wee my pants!`

Two swings, edge of the world
