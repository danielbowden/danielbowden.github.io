Crossing from Peru into Bolivia was uneventful with the border taking a matter of minutes to get our exit and entry stamps and we were on our way without as much as a question, let alone a bag search. Now on the other side of Lake Titicaca, our first stop was Copacabana, a small lakefront town catering mostly to tourists and the usual hippies that have stopped in and never left.

Late that afternoon we climbed the mountain lookout overlooking the town and lake to watch the sunset. Not looking at a map beforehand we set out towards the mountain at the base of the lookout and couldn't find the path to the top. With daylight dying we took the hard way and literally climbed straight up, heading towards the people we could see already perched at the top. We reached the top hot and sweaty but had made it in time for sunset and were rewarded with a great view over the lake looking back towards Peru.

The following morning we took a day trip out to Isla del Sol. Info?? The boat landed on the north part of the island and we opted to walk from there to the south, a near three hours through amazing landscapes reaching heights of 4000m?? and giving us panoramic views over the clear, blue water and the snowy mountains of the Andes in the distance. By mid afternoon it was time to take a boat back to the mainland and grab some quick food before jumping on a bus that evening to La Paz. The bus was a wild ride, spending more time overtaking and beeping other cars than staying in our own lane. Whatever race we were in I was convinced we were winning and on multiple occasions just as we would fall sleep the bus would hit a bump so hard that our bodies left the seat. Already cheating death, at around 10pm we arrived at the waters edge of ??? separating the peninsula?? with the rest of the country. Any other country would just build a bridge across the XXm span but thrifty?? Bolivia instead decided they would just drive large buses down off the road and with the help of pieces of wood as ramps drive them onto a floating metal barge just big enough for one bus. We disembarked and paid our "ferry" fee before being escorted onto a smaller passenger boat. Together our boat and our bus made their way across the cold, rough water in complete darkness without any lights on as other boats, buses and trucks doing the same passed us in both directions. We laughed that it was all part of the adventure and reassured ourselves that as we could see the land on either side we could make the swim if it came to that.

##La Paz

Getting off the bus in La Paz we were unfortunately not in the clear yet as we hailed the closest taxi to take us to our hostel. The driver took us to what turned out to be the old location of the hostel and after assuring us this was the one drove off. We walked up and down the dark empty street at midnight knocking on random doors and windows hoping to get inside. Unsure what to do and with near empty phone battery we were saved by a taxi driver that stopped and tried to explain to us that we were in the wrong place in Spanish. After paying the taxi fare again we made it to the right place tired and keen to get into the room after the long day.

La Paz info???

As planned, the following day was XXX, or Day of the Dead. A tradition throughout Latin America that involves celebrating the life ??. We rode the Tereferico?? up and over the busy cemetery for a better view of the city before coming back down and taking a walk through the cemetery grounds. More description??

La Paz markets info?? Huge, so much so that there is not really supermarkets in that part of the city. We walked through the sprawling markets, passing from section to section to see stalls selling everything from your typical fruits and vegetables to beds, toys, clothing, electronics, and our favourite, food. We tried everything we could starting with a 5 boliviano ($1 AUD) choripan each (chorizo roll with ???), chocolate coated strawberries, passionfruit sorbet and finally an odd but interesting beer spider consisting of a large glass filled with beer, beaten egg white and thick cream.

Joining a walking tour we were guided around the city, through government square where we gained some insight into the history and ??past of Bolvia. The guide led us to the strange witch markets containing potions?? llama fetuses, ??.

 Having both several years ago read the book [Marching Powder](http://www.amazon.com??) about the infamous San Pedro Prison in La Paz we were shocked, yet strangely excited, to be finally seeing it in person. Written by Rusty Young??, an Australian backpacker turned author, it details the unbelievable yet fascinating and horrifying story of an English drug smuggler imprisoned in the jail and his struggle to survive in ??? Saw young kids and mothers leaving. Tried to take photos. To have such a big and serious prison in the middle of the city is unusual with everyone going about their day in the neighbouring park tourists and locals. Prison tours

Info on Bolivia in general?? War?? lost access to the ocean?? poor??

Not far out of La Paz is the infamous "Death Road", also known as the most dangerous road in the world?? Facts??. With a sheer drop of up to 400m in parts and no railings to stop you, the narrow dirt and gravel road leaves little chance for survival in the event of an accident over the edge. Unlike in the rest of the country, the side of the road changes to the left for this stretch of road so that the drivers can look out their window and make sure their cliff-side wheels are still touching solid ground as they inch their way around other vehicles coming in the opposite direction. 

We signed up for a tour and, much to our parent's dismay, spent the day riding down this crumbling "road", dodging fallen rocks, puddles and potholes XX??km alongside the intimidating edge and tried our best to concentrate on looking forward rather than down. We had chosen the aptly named Gravity, the most expensive but highly reputable Death Road tour company, reasoning that it was worth spending the extra money when safety was involved. The downhill mountain bikes we were given were practically brand new 2014-15 models and our guides were experienced and thorough in their safety briefing. One guide assured us that unlike other companies they even carry 50m of rescue rope and if you fall any further than that they figure there is no rush to get you back up...

?? Once again, one of the times that it is better off telling them back home when it is over. Top Gear episode. Crosses on the side of the road. With such serious consequences The seriousness of the situation was felt. Whilst little peddling had been involved in the XXXm vertical drop With a vertical drop of We made it to the bottom without incident and after sharing high fives with the group and a relieved hug with each other we celebrated with a well earned beer and some lunch before heading back to La Paz in the mini bus, with the driver opting to drive back up Death Road...

##Amazon jungle

The Amazon jungle stretches ??? and is ???.
We had chosen to visit the jungle from Bolivia not only because it is cheaper than in other countries but because it seemed like safety came second to adventure and the activities on offer in the tours were far more "hands on" and exciting.

Opting for the more expensive 45 minute flight to Rurrenabaque?? over the ~20+ hour bus along cliff top roads, we figured we should stay longer to justify the costs and signed up for both a 3-day Jungle tour and a 3-day Pampus tour.

With the Jungle?? tour up first our small group of three climbed into a long, skinny boat and headed up the ?? river to camp. We were first shown around the eco-lodge but with the help of the guide's persuasion decided to spend the first night deep in the jungle instead and loaded up our bags with everything we would need from sleeping bags and tarps?? to food and water. This tour was to be more about the jungle itself with emphasis on its many plants and insects, and learning how these have been used by locals for not just food but for both medicinal and survival purposes.

On the walk to our overnight camp spot we stopped many times for a rest and to learn about our surroundings. Firstly we tasted live termites (minty in flavour and a good source of protein) and then further along chopped a vine out of a tree and drank the fresh water trapped inside. Continuing on we smelt the root of plant used to help headaches, and found a big vine hanging from tall trees and stopped to all have a swing.

Arriving at a clearing we began to set up camp, laying out a tarp to cover the group before pulling another up over some sticks for a roof. After tying?? up mosquito nets to cover our sleeping bags camp was complete and we set off to collect firewood for without fire there would be no dinner. Sweaty from chopping wood with a machete in the hot and humid jungle we walked down to the river to cool off with a swim watching the sunset.

For a dinner cooked in the dark on a fireplace it was impressive and afterwards we sat chatting with our two guides in the best Spanish we could muster. When it was time for bed we got into our mosquito nets and fell asleep to the sounds of the jungle all around us.

Waking up to the same sounds the following day we set off walking through the dense, humid jungle with our guide, Miguel, up in front recklessly chopping us a path with his machete. We stopped to try some wild garlic and then to eat live worms for a snack and were surprised when they tasted like coconut. Finding a rubber tree, Miguel stuck leaves to Lauren's ears as earrings and then we all had a go crushing some leaves in our palms and watching it eventually turn purple. It is used as both a dye for material as well as a natural insect repellent and so we took turns painting each others faces and arms before Miguel decided to dip Lauren's fringe in the dye turning her once bright blonde hair colour into a dark purple. According to him it would wash right out but later that afternoon when she tried unsuccessfully to wash it out he changed his answer to a couple of days, she was not too impressed??. Today, close to a month since leaving the jungle Lauren hilariously still has a purple fringe!
