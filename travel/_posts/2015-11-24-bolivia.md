Crossing from Peru into Bolivia was uneventful with the border taking a matter of minutes to get our exit and entry stamps and we were on our way without as much as a question, let alone a bag search. Now on the other side of Lake Titicaca, our first stop was Copacabana, a small lakefront town catering mostly to tourists and the usual hippies that have stopped in and never left.

Late that afternoon we climbed the mountain lookout overlooking the town and lake to watch the sunset. Not looking at a map beforehand we set out towards the mountain at the base of the lookout and couldn't find the path to the top. With daylight dying we took the hard way and literally climbed straight up, heading towards the people we could see already perched at the top. We reached the top hot and sweaty but had made it in time for sunset and were rewarded with a great view over the lake looking back towards Peru.

The following morning we took a day trip out to Isla del Sol. Info?? The boat landed on the north part of the island and we opted to walk from there to the south, a near three hours through amazing landscapes reaching heights of 4000m?? and giving us panoramic views over the clear, blue water and the snowy mountains of the Andes in the distance. By mid afternoon it was time to take a boat back to the mainland and grab some quick food before jumping on a bus that evening to La Paz. The bus was a wild ride, spending more time overtaking and beeping other cars than staying in our own lane. Whatever race we were in I was convinced we were winning and on multiple occasions just as we would fall sleep the bus would hit a bump so hard that our bodies left the seat. Already cheating death, at around 10pm we arrived at the waters edge of ??? separating the peninsula?? with the rest of the country. Any normal country would just build a bridge across the XXm span but thrifty?? Bolivia instead decided they would just drive large buses down off the road and with the help of pieces of wood as ramps drive them onto a floating metal barge just big enough for one bus. We disembarked and paid our "ferry" fee before being escorted onto a smaller passenger boat. Together our boat and our bus made their way across the cold, rough water in complete darkness without any lights on as other boats, buses and trucks doing the same passed us in both directions. We laughed that it was all part of the adventure and reassured ourselves that as we could see the land on either side we could make the swim if it came to that.

##La Paz

Getting off the bus in La Paz we were unfortunately not in the clear yet as we hailed the closest taxi to take us to our hostel. The driver took us to what turned out to be the old location of the hostel and after assuring us this was the one drove off. We walked up and down the dark empty street at midnight knocking on random doors and windows hoping to get inside. Unsure what to do and with near empty phone battery we were saved by a taxi driver that stopped and tried to explain to us that we were in the wrong place in Spanish. After paying the taxi fare again we made it to the right place tired and keen to get into the room after the long day.

La Paz info???

As planned, the following day was XXX, or Day of the Dead. A tradition throughout Latin America that involves celebrating the life ??. We rode the Tereferico?? up and over the busy cemetery for a better view of the city before coming back down and taking a walk through the cemetery grounds. More description??

La Paz markets info?? Huge, so much so that there is not really supermarkets in that part of the city. We walked through the sprawling markets, passing from section to section to see stalls selling everything from your typical fruits and vegetables to beds, toys, clothing, electronics, and our favourite, food. We tried everything we could starting with a 5 boliviano ($1 AUD) choripan each (chorizo roll with ???), chocolate coated strawberries, passionfruit sorbet and finally an odd but interesting beer spider consisting of a large glass filled with beer, beaten egg white and thick cream.

Joining a walking tour we were guided around the city, through government square where we gained some insight into the history and ??past of Bolvia. The guide led us to the strange witch markets containing potions?? llama fetuses, ??.

 Having both several years ago read the book [Marching Powder](http://www.amazon.com) about the infamous San Pedro Prison in La Paz we were shocked, yet strangely excited, to be finally seeing it in person. Written by Rusty Young??, an Australian backpacker turned author, it details the unbelievable yet fascinating and horrifying story of an English drug smuggler imprisoned in the jail and his struggle to survive in ??? Saw young kids and mothers leaving. Tried to take photos. To have such a big and serious prison in the middle of the city is unusual with everyone going about their day in the neighbouring park tourists and locals. Prison tours

Info on Bolivia in general?? War?? lost access to the ocean?? poor??

Death road. Good company, worth spending the extra money. Facts, dangers, cliffs. Guide assuringly stated that they carry 50m of rescue rope and if you fall any further than that they figure there is no rush to get you back up. Side of the road changes to the left so that the drivers can look out the window and make sure their cliff side wheels are still on solid ground.

Dinosaur footprints
watched funny but informative animated show on dinosaurs- got shown the dinosaur replicas and signs explaining how the plates moved, collided together and forced the land up into mountains. This is why the wall is vertical- It used to be the edge of a lake where dinosaurs would come down and drink from. That is why the footprints are in straight lines
•	Walked down the hill for our tour- close up look at footprints. Got shown other prints. Explained about the sediment layers that were formed over millions of years which were hiding the footprints.
•	The concrete company were mining and couldn’t use that part of the mountain because the rock is not strong enough- over a few years the rock eroded to reveal the footprints
