With a long bus through the desert from San Pedro de Atacama we arrived in Salta, our first stop in Argentina. As explained in my previous post we moved in and out of both Argentina and neighbouring [Chile](/travel/2015/12/29/chile) as we made our way down the continent in order to avoid any backtracking through the long, skinny countries. 

Upon entering Argentina the first point of call was a much anticipated Argentinian steak. I had been hearing nothing but good things about the quality and size of the meat portions as we made our way through South America, and so it was safe to say it was something I was very much looking forward to. I continued to eat steak for dinner five times in the next six days, only making the mistake of straying to chicken once. The size of the steaks would bring a vegetarian to tears, the prices were amazingly good value and they were always cooked to perfection. In our month long stay in the country steak became my regular meal, sometimes even twice a day...

Salta is located in the north west of Argentina, and is a populated city with old, colonial architecture. Like all Spanish cities it had a prominent town square with a cathedral, town hall, museum, a park and plenty of restaurants. We had been advised by several people in the months gone by about Argentina's unofficial "Blue Dollar" currency market and to stock up on as much US Dollar as we could prior to entering Argentina. This black market currency exchange was born out of necessity for local citizens to get around the governments tight currency controls and instability of their Argentinian Peso in what is a poorly managed country and economy. Despite this parallel market being considered illegal the people making use of it are far from your typical criminal. Tourists, locals planning overseas travel, businesses, or just regular Joe's trying to protect their savings against inflation all make up what is thousands of blue transactions every day. For many locals, despite it being more expensive than going through official channels, it is easier, and in the long run possibly safer to literally keep money under their mattress than in a bank account. Why am I telling you all of this? Well from a tourist perspective, with the local demand for foreign currency so high, if you were smart about it you could save a lot of money. For example if we were to use our card in a store or an ATM machine we would get the official government rate of, at the time, around `1USD = 9.6ARS`. Whereas if we went to a street currency dealer the best we managed to get was `1USD = 15.5ARS`, a 60%+ difference.  We spent a few thousand dollars between us during our time in the country which meant taking advantage of the Blue Dollar resulted in hundreds of dollars difference. Fortunately, we never had a problem with fake notes though with their highest note being 100ARS ($6.45 USD) we spent a lot of time inspecting each note of the large bundles as we were making the exchange. Whilst at times it was incredibly inconvenient to go and change more money just so you could buy dinner, we chalked it up as just another quirk or hurdle when it came to travelling.

Looking to get out of the city for the day we took a day trip to Quebrada de las Conchas. Driving through the amazing landscape of multi-coloured mountains and gorges, we stopped many times for photos and to learn about the geological formation of the area.

Argentina is also famously known for its soft, baked empanadas. Conveniently located a short walk from our hostel was the 'Patio of Empanadas', an open air style area of small shops selling empanadas. Turning it more into an activity than just a meal we sat repeatedly ordering, "dos mas" from the wide variety on the menu. Even after 10 filling empanadas between us the total bill came to $7 AUD.

##Mendoza

The quality of buses surprisingly and disappointedly dropped in comparison to [Peru](/travel/2015/10/31/peru) whilst the price doubled, or in some cases even tripled! The 18 hour overnight bus trip from Salta was not nearly as painful as it sounds with the both of us well and truly used to sleeping on buses by now.

On our first full day we made our way by local bus out to the ?? hot springs, and hopped between its many pools, ranging in temperature from freezing to scalding. Surrounded by mountains and cliffs, we lay about in the sun for most of the day until an employee came around to kick us out at closing time.

The Mendoza region is internationally  renowned/recognised?? ??. Mendoza is most renowned for its wine 
We joined a wine tasting tour, taking us by van to several of the area's wineries from small family owned boutiques pushing out XX bottles a year to large modern companies producing XXXXs??. In a region famous for Malbec?? the tastings were solely red wine. There was no hiding the fact that we know nothing about wine nor do we drink it at home but we actually enjoyed the tastings and may finally be turning into adults.

##Bariloche

Back in Argentina after a few weeks in Chile, we continued heading further south to Bariloche, a town ??? we had officially made it into the start of Patagonia??. With snowcapped mountains visible and a constant icy wind blowing through town it was freezing, and being only December I shudder to think what it would be like in winter. We dug out all our warm clothes we had been carrying for months and layered up to explore the town.
The town's Swiss?? influence is ??. We shamelessly walked in and out of each of the chocolate shops, feigning interest to get free samples at each one and turning the morning into an impromptu chocolate shop crawl. We got the feeling that they had seen our scruffy backpacker type before and were either giving us pity samples or the young casual staff couldn't care less who they gave chocolates to.

Somewhat recovered from hiking Villarrica Volcano in [Pucón, Chile](/travel/2015/12/29/chile) just days before we were ready to face yet another hike. We set off to follow the Circuito de Chico for the day with the first stop hiking Cerro Campanario. We took the steep trail up beside the chairlift full of cheaters taking the easy way up and after a quick but strenuous walk we were rewarded with amazing panoramic views at the top of the surrounding lakes.

{% include image.html img="images/travel/imageName.jpg" title="The view from Cerro Campanario" %}

After making our way back down we continued around the circuit, hiking through thick, peaceful forests to the summit of Llao llao having barely seen another person for the last few hours. We enjoyed lunch and a well earned rest on a cliff overlooking the river below surrounded by snow capped mountains.

{% include image.html img="images/travel/imageName.jpg" title="Perfect spot for lunch" %}

{% include image.html img="images/travel/imageName.jpg" title="Taking in the views" %}

We walked several kilometres to the next viewpoint, ??, over a lake before continuing down the hill to the shore. Exhausted from walking all day we were ready to head back. Still close to 15km from town we gave up at the base of the next steep hill and hitch-hiked our way back to town.

Other popular hike in Bariloche is to Refugio Frey. Starting at the base of Cerro Catedral ski resort the trail takes you into the National Park and through a wide variety of scenery, with forests, streams, lakes and towering peaks. The 24km round trip took around 4 hours each way and was relatively easy going apart from the final climb to the refuge built on the edge of the lake. The snowcapped peaks reflected in the water as we ate lunch in the sun on the shore sitting in some home made sun lounges and admiring the view.

##El Chaltén

Getting this far down the continent the towns became few and far between. After a 22 hour bus ride to El Chaltén we were 1,400kms further south into Patagonia and worlds away from the hot, tropical beaches of Central America only five months earlier. The sunrise arrival into El Chaltén and its Parque Nacional Los Glaciers (Glaciers National Park) instantly validated?? our decision to aim for Patagonia as we were rewarded with this view.

{% include image.html img="images/travel/imageName.jpg" title="Entering Parque los Glaciers" %}

Sick of sitting for that long on a bus we explored the town that afternoon before preparing for the early start for the next day of hiking. Our first hike was Laguna de los tres, a 25km round trip with breathtaking views of the glacier and surrounding mountains. The majority of the walk up was straightforward and easygoing until reaching the base of the mountain where steep steps and slippery slopes made the last hour up the hardest part of the day. At the top we found two stunning, bright blue lakes both fed by waterfalls of glacier water.

Backing up the following day we were off on another hike, this time 22km, to Laguna Torres. We walked through thick forests, wide open glacially formed valleys and up and over mountains before finally arriving at the lake. We walked down to lake level and had some lunch sitting in the sun watching the bright blue glacier icebergs float around in the water in front of us. Rested and fed we continued up above the lake for a better view of the glacier below.

After two long days of walking we rewarded ourselves that night with a local speciality, Patagonian lamb. Despite the country being renowned for its beef, it takes a backseat in Patagonia with the region instead famous for its free range, grass fed lamb, exporting it worldwide. The traditional cooking method dates back to the gaucho (cowboy) era and involves a whole lamb being cut lengthways and spread vertically onto an iron cross to be cooked over an open wood fire and coals for upwards of three hours. The result is some beautifully slow cooked meat that falls off the bone and has a crispy seasoned skin.

##El Calafate

Still within the 726,927 hectare Los Glaciares National Park we continued 220km south to El Calafate. By far the main attraction in the area is the Perito Moreno Glacier, one of the more accessible glaciers in the world. At 250km<sup>2</sup> it is the world's third largest reserve of fresh water and unlike most other glaciers that are retreating as a result of changing climates, Perito Moreno is still advancing and remarkably at a rate of up to two metres a day. 

We eagerly made our way along the walkways and balconies built in front of the 5km wide and 74m high front face. Constant loud cracking could be heard as the ice shifted sending huge car-sized blocks falling into the turquoise water below.

I could've watched it roar and split apart for hours but we were off to the boat to get a much closer look. Not wanting to miss out, we had booked a mini trekking tour several days earlier and after a quick lunch were fitted with crampons and were making our way up and onto the glacier on foot. We were very lucky to get clear blue skies and sunshine making perfect conditions for seeing the spectacular formations and deep blue colours in the ice, and down into the big, bottomless crevasses. I crouched down and filled up my drink bottle from a pool of running glacier water in the crevasse and it was some of the clearest and freshest tasting water I've ever had. Its funny to think that after all this time away and so many amazing experiences already that yet another activity could come along and make it high on the list but the trek was incredible and easily one of the highlights of the trip.

With Christmas nearing we left El Calafate and Argentina and crossed back into [Chile](/travel/2015/12/29/chile), pushing further south towards the bottom of the continent.

##Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires is a large, modern city featuring many of the comforts and facilities of home. It is home to XXXXXX??? people and info??

We flew up from Rio Gallegos??, Patagonian Chile the day before New Years Eve and stayed in a party hostel for the first 4 days to make the most of our celebrations.

On NYE the party started at the hostel where we were fortunate to find we had many people to celebrate. Lewis, a friend we had made back in the Amazon Jungle in Bolivia, was staying at the same hostel and had a group of friends with him. We also ran into several other people we had met along the way down South America. With the hostel party finishing at 2am, and already well past Lauren's bedtime, they had organised buses to transport the hundreds of people to a huge oceanfront nightclub that spanned across indoor and outdoor stages and dance floors. We drank and danced along with thousands of locals until the sun came up and we decided it was time to leave at 7am.

As we had discovered the whole way down Argentina, the country is famous for meat and we delightfully?? discovered Buenos Aires is the pinnacle?? of this. Huge steaks could be found in restaurants on almost every street and were always cooked to perfection. We visited one of the more popular steak restaurants I didn't hesitate to order the 800g monster of a ??? steak. Lauren impressively chose the 400g and in our quest to be adults we both ordered wine. We both polished off what was one of the thickest and most tender steaks we had ever had along with many small side dishes that they threw in before we slowly waddled our way home unable to move for the rest of the night.

Recoleta?? Cemetery and markets
La Boca tour
San Telmo markets
Moved to Palermo neighbourhood. Big selection of food. Sushi, crepes, ice cream, etc

##Puerto Iguazu??

Iguazu?? falls facts

Visa information. Buenos Aires 15min slots booked out until late January. Faking a flight itinerary. We had heard from others and from reading some blogs that there was a small consulate in Puerto Iguazu. More like a house with a sign. Handed over money and our passports to the non-uniformed guys behind the desk. Came back 26 hours later and it was done. We were going to Brazil afterall!


I started keeping count of all the things Lauren has lost this trip but when I had to start wearing shoes in the colder countries I lost count
