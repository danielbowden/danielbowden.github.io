Minutes after picking up our visas, we left [Argentina](/travel/2016/01/08/argentina) and headed straight for the border. Not keen on waiting for us, the bus dropped us off and continued into Brazil while we stood and waited at the typical South American border crossing with its long, slow moving line and single processing window. Finally through, we gave up on another bus and instead took a taxi to our accommodation in Foz do Iguaçu, a town on the Brazilian side of the falls.

Immediately on entering Brazil and being confronted with the Portuguese language we realised just how comfortable we had become with Spanish after spending the past XX?? months immersed in it. It had got to the point where we felt we could communicate well enough to get by, not only to order food, ask directions or buy bus tickets but engage in basic conversation and even the occasional joke. Whilst we often couldn't think fast enough, or lacked confidence to reply in Spanish, it was both amazing and satisfying that when it came to listening we understood more than we realised. After months of fumbling our way through daily interactions and the odd Spanish-only tour we were finally getting it and could only imagine what it would be like to go back to the start of the trip knowing what we know now. We were shocked, perhaps naively, at just how different Portuguese is and it was unsettling, embarrassing and sometimes frustrating to find that we were back to square one barely able to manage more than numbers, thank you and please. 

The following morning we took a bus out to Iguaçu Falls to experience it from the Brazilian side. Lying?? in the middle of ?? the grounds are full of wildlife from butterflies, birds and tarantulas to brazen?? ?? covering the paths and trying to get into people's bags. Iguacu Falls facts. This side of the falls were far less crowded, and though the paths didn't lead out to the edge of Devils Throat like in [Argentina](/travel/2016/01/08/argentina), they still offered some amazing close-up views and allowed us to get staggeringly close leaving us soaked from head to toe.

Hot, wet and smelly from spending the day walking around the falls in the humid weather we got back to the hostel and quickly showered and changed ready to go to the bus station for an overnight bus XXhrs?? to Florianopolis??.

## Florianópolis

Florianópolis, Floripa for short, is ?? island.

We spent the first few days in Lagoa da Conceição, a small trendy town with many cafes, health food stores, food trucks and surf shops??. Arriving from inland Brazil, and before that city of Buenos Aires, and the cold mountains of Patagonia it was finally time to get the boardshorts back out and enjoy the beach. We joined the rest of the population and lay on the beach for the first two days, firstly visiting Joaquina beach and Praia Mole the following day. Brazilians love the beach!?? Umbrellas covered every piece of the sand, filled with families settled in for the day. People walked along the beach selling everything from beer and cocktails, to food, coconuts, clothing and sunglasses and as expected, girls in tiny bikinis could be seen in every direction.

Whilst we loved the majority of the food throughout the trip, Brazil and especially Floripa, was definitely a highlight. It was hard to go wrong at meal time when fresh seafood was the local speciality. I've never eaten so many prawns in the space of a week. A sure favourite for the both of us, and one of the most traditional dishes served in Floripa, was the sequência de camarão (sequence of prawns). Ordering it twice in three days, the $30AUD meal for two consisted of plate after plate full of prawns cooked in all sorts of ways including breaded, barbecued, garlic, and a huge fish fillet covered in tomato prawns as well accompaniments like rice, chips and salad.

I had first heard of Florianópolis from a Brazilian friend back home. I used to work with Rodrigo and he would often tell me that if I ever went to Brazil I had to visit his hometown and so when we finally got our visas and entered Brazil I contacted him to let him know. Unbeknownst to us both Rodrigo and his wife Guta?? kindly put a post on Facebook reaching out to any friends and family that would be able to show us some Brazilian hospitality. We were overwhelmed by how many people seemingly dropped everything and kindly offered their help. 

First up was Michel, along his wife and son, who picked us up from our hostel early one morning and took us out for a whole day tour of the southern part of the island. Like many other young Brazilians we met, Michel's son Pedro spoke English and was very helpful in translating whenever either side got stuck. After making our way south we parked the car and started the day with a 40 minute walk through the bush to one of Michel's favourite spots, a near empty beach with clear blue water and bright green dense jungle all the way to the sand. It was far from the umbrella and salesman filled beaches of the days before and we enjoyed a refreshing swim and bodysurf watching dolphins pass by not far from the shore. Together we all walked along the beach and climbed up to a lighthouse for a panoramic view of the area down below. When lunchtime came around we had fresh fish sitting at tables in the sand in front of a small hut-like restaurant. Further to their generosity, Michel refused to accept any money for the meal and instead we walked back to the car to continue our drive around the island. We visited lookouts, beaches, small towns and finally the shop of a family friend where we enjoyed açaí bowls overlooking the lake. Lauren and I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with Michel and his family and were grateful to have a local be able to be show us the kind of places that we never would have known about, let alone been able to get to on our own.

Now staying in another neighbourhood, Barra da Lagoa, the next morning Lauren and I walked to the nearby natural pools. We sat in the sun and jumped from the rocks into the water to cool down. Looking back towards the beach covered in people the ocean rockpools were far quieter and more relaxing.

That afternoon after another sequência de camarão lunch at a restaurant overlooking the beach we were picked up by Rodrigo's sister Andrea and her daughter Bianca. We had organised to spend a few days staying with their family in their beachside apartment in the north of Florianópolis. Bianca spoke fluent English, and her younger sister Leticia was also learning which was very helpful when we got stuck but before long the whole family was trying to learn, especially their dad Carlos who, despite his daughters constantly laughing at him, did impressively well. They also taught us some basic Portuguese and together we communicated fine. 

By this stage I had been travelling for over a year and it was such a nice change from hostel life to be in a beautiful clean house, with our own bedroom and a clean bathroom and kitchen. The family all went out of their way to make us feel welcome from showing us their favourite spots around the area, taking us out for a fancy lunch on the waterfront, driving us to places we wanted to visit, introducing us to local foods like tapioca and brigadeiros and helping to organise our time in Rio for carnival after we made a late decision to extend the trip. Living in a household full of girls I think Carlos was happy to have another guy in the house and was always keen to have a beer on the verandah whenever we had the chance. Showing a keen interest in our trip we brought up some of our [travel videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGMUjKx_Tpei9dYAmxLnnPA) on their TV, wary not to bore them with a modern day version of the old travel slideshow. Turns out they loved them and insisted we show more.

Whilst Floripa is a popular tourist destination for both Brazilians and foreigners alike, up in the northern part of the island two Australian's were still a bit of a novelty. Everyone we met was so friendly and enthusiastic to talk to us, from people waiting with us in line for hotdogs, to the sushi restaurant where the chef came out to meet us and give us some free sushi when we finished our meal. Most people we met knew someone that had either been to or currently lives in Australia.

Lauren had read about a famous day club called P12 located right on the beach in Jurerê Internacional, a very wealthy suburb where the richest Brazilians including actors and soccer players have their summer beach houses. P12 hosts big pool parties every weekend and so that Saturday we got a lift from Andrea and went to check it out. The huge pool, bars, music and atmosphere rivalled that of Vegas along with a big dancefloor, VIP lounges and pricetags to match. We had great weather and drank in the pool for the majority of the day before watching the live concert of popular Brazilian artist Nando Reis.

On our final day in Floripa we took a bus down to Guarda do Embaú as recommended by Carlos and paid $1 to get a short boat ride across the river to the beach. The river mouth is popular with stand-up paddleboarders and the beach a popular surf spot. We found a spot on the sand and I went out for a swim with my camera in the big surf to try and get some better shots of the surfers from in the water. The lifeguards came along on jetskis to tell the swimmers around me to get back closer to shore but saw what I was up to and just smiled and gave me a thumbs up.

That evening we sadly said goodbye to Andrea and her family, thanking our new friends repeatedly for all their help, generosity and hospitality during our stay. We shared Facebook details and gave Andrea a card and present, her response needed no translation.

`"minha casa é sua casa (my house is your house)"`

## Paraty

The trip to Paraty via São Paulo ended up taking a slow and frequently interrupted 26 hours. The travel time was not helped by an ongoing Brazilian trend that once everyone is asleep to then stop the bus and get them off at 3am for a 45 minute restaurant break.

Paraty is a small coastal town surrounded by jungled mountains between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Its Portuguese colonial center has cobbled streets and 17th and 18th century buildings dating back to the gold rush. Our first day in town was wet and gloomy and we did our best to explore whilst struggling over the rugged, slippery cobblestone streets and puddles. The following morning we had booked a trip around the bay and set off from the dock aboard a pirate ship style boat. We stopped at several small, tropical beaches including Praia da Lula and Agua Azul and despite the grey weather continuing to linger we still enjoyed ourselves and swam in the clean, clear water off the side of the boat.

{% include image.html img="images/travel/imageName.jpg" title="titleText" %}

With little sunshine forecast and a bed bug incident, which in all honesty I was surprised had taken that long, we left Paraty by bus continuing north to Ihla Grande.  

## Ihla Grande

Ihla Grande is an island located off the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro that remains largely undeveloped, free of roads and not a single motorised vehicle. What was once a leper colony and later a high security prison, the island's scenic landscape and unspoilt tropical beaches now make it a popular tourist destination.

Like clockwork just as we boarded the speed boat it started to pour rain. The only seats left were at the very front and so we both huddled behind Lauren's tiny umbrella with all our bags and battled the rain and wind for the 1 hour 15 minute trip across to the island.

Thankfully the sun came out just after we arrived and so we made our way to our hostel, checked in and returned to the dock to find a taxi boat to take us to a nearby beach. The boat dropped us in a quiet bay filled with clear, blue water and palm trees lining the shore. Walking in the direction of the driver's pointing we found a track at the back of the sand and followed it through the dense bushland, across the island to Lopes Mendes, a beach on the southern side of the island.

{% include image.html img="images/travel/imageName.jpg" title="Lopes Mendes beach" %}

The nightlife consisted of live music and dance performances by locals along the beachfront, while the usual transient hippies that we had found common in these sorts of places sold handmade jewellery and souvenirs. Unsurprisingly, we both became very familiar with the large dessert carts being pushed around town selling locally made cakes, slices, biscuits and other treats.

The next full day we took off on a full day boat tour around the island stopping to swim at popular spots such as Lagoa Azul (Blue lagoon), Lagoa Verde (Green lagoon), Praia de Amor (Love beach) and Praia Feiticeira (Witch beach).

## Rio de Janeiro

We organised a boat back to the mainland and a van to take us up to Rio, first staying in the ??fancy and wealthy beach suburb Ipanema for two nights. Keen to enjoy the sun we spent the first afternoon at the beach, renting an umbrella and beach chairs from one of the many vendors. Beaches in Brazil are unlike anything I had seen, there was of course the salesman walking up and down the beach that I had mentioned earlier, but also bars with food, cocktails, coconuts, a sprinkler wetting a path into the stretch of sand from the road to the shore so that you didn't burn your feet, and the vendors pumped fresh water showers down to their stall so you could rinse off. There was even a generator powering a router sitting under its own umbrella to give that vendor's customers beach wifi!

That night we went to a street party along the beachfront. Everywhere you looked was someone with an eski selling cold beers so you could just buy them as you walked along. Thousands of young people. Found the band towards the end of the party. Danced.

Daily acai bowls with fruit and granola. Info?? Cheap, filling, refreshing, and healthy??

Sugarloaf mountain

Churrascaria. Amazing. Buffet plus meat sticks.

Lapa steps.

Moved hostels to cococabana beach. Late afternoon spent at the beach. Sat on the sand drinking beer and coconuts and reading until 8pm.

## Arraial do Cabo

Extended meant that not only could we be in rio for Carnival but we got to go up north for 6 days and relax on the beaches of Arraial de Cabo and Buzios. We weren't yet ready to go home. Discovered it on Instagram of all places.

## Búzios

## Carnival

Blocos

Sambadrome

When last years champion school finished their amazing performance through the sambadrome Lauren turned to me and said "that performance alone was worth the extra $1000 to change my flight home".

Starting in Japan and now finishing in Brazil, I've been in serious denial about coming home for the last few weeks but after 13 months since my last day of work it is unfortunately time. Looking forward to catching up with everyone... after a casual 53 hour journey home


Food by the kilo!
