Minutes after picking up our visas, we left [Argentina](/travel/2016/01/08/argentina) and headed straight for the border. Not keen on waiting for us, the bus dropped us off and continued into Brazil while we stood and waited at the typical South American border crossing with its long, slow moving line and single processing window. Finally through, we gave up on another bus and instead took a taxi to our accommodation in Foz de Iguaçu??, a town on the Brazilian side of the falls.

Immediately on entering Brazil and being confronted with the Portuguese language we realised just how comfortable we had become with Spanish after spending the past XX?? months immersed in it. It had got to the point where we felt we could communicate well enough to get by, not only to order food, ask directions or buy bus tickets but engage in basic conversation and even the occasional joke. Whilst we often couldn't think fast enough, or lacked confidence to reply in Spanish, it was both amazing and satisfying that when it came to listening we understood more than we realised. After months of fumbling our way through daily interactions and the odd Spanish-only tour we were finally getting it and could only imagine what it would be like to go back to the start of the trip knowing what we know now. We were shocked, perhaps naively, at just how different Portuguese is and it was unsettling, embarrassing and sometimes frustrating to find that we were back to square one barely able to manage more than numbers, thank you and please. 

The following morning we took a bus out to Iguaçu Falls to experience it from the Brazilian side. Lying?? in the middle of ?? the grounds are full of wildlife from butterflies, birds and tarantulas to brazen?? ?? covering the paths and trying to get into people's bags. Iguacu Falls facts. This side of the falls were far less crowded, and though the paths didn't lead out to the edge of Devils Throat like in [Argentina](/travel/2016/01/08/argentina), they still offered some amazing close-up views and allowed us to get staggeringly close leaving us soaked from head to toe.

Hot, wet and smelly from spending the day walking around the falls in the humid weather we got back to the hostel and quickly showered and changed ready to go to the bus station for an overnight bus XXhrs?? to Florianopolis??.

## Florianópolis

Florianópolis, Floripa for short, is ?? island.

We spent the first few days in Lagoa de Conceicao??, a small trendy town with many cafes, health food stores, food trucks and surf shops??. Arriving from inland Brazil, and before that city of Buenos Aires, and the cold mountains of Patagonia it was finally time to get the boardshorts back out and enjoy the beach. We joined the rest of the population and lay on the beach for the first two days, firstly visiting Joaquina beach and Praia Mole the following day. Brazilians love the beach!?? Umbrellas covered every piece of the sand, filled with families settled in for the day. People walked along the beach selling everything from beer and cocktails, to food, coconuts, clothing and sunglasses and as expected, tiny bikinis could be seen in every direction.

Whilst we loved the majority of the food throughout the trip, Brazil and especially Floripa, was definitely a highlight. It was hard to go wrong at meal time when fresh seafood was the local speciality. I've never eaten so many prawns in the space of a week. A sure favourite for the both of us was the ??sequencia da camerones??. Ordering it twice in three days, the $30AUD meal for two consisted of plate after plate full of prawns cooked in all sorts of ways including breaded, barbecued, garlic, and a huge fish fillet covered in tomato prawns.

I had first heard of Floripa from a Brazilian friend back home. I used to work with Rodrigo and he would often tell me that if I ever went to Brazil I had to visit his hometown of Floripa. Rodrigo and his wife Guta kindly put a post on Facebook reaching out to friends and family that would be able to show us some Brazilian hospitality. We were overwhelmed by how many people seemingly dropped everything and kindly offered their help. First up was Michel and his wife ?? and son ?? who picked us up from our hostel early one morning and took us out for a whole day tour of the Southern part of the island.

We started with a 40 minute walk through the bush to one of Michel's favourite spots, a near empty beach with clear blue water and bright green dense jungle all the way to the send. It was far from the umbrella and salesman filled beaches of the days before and we enjoyed a refreshing swim and bodysurf before enjoying some sandwiches ?? had made for us while watching dolphins pass by not far from the shore. We walked along the beach together and climbed up to a lighthouse for a panoramic view of the area down below. Kindly bought us fresh fish for lunch on the beach.
Now staying in another neighbourhood, Barra da Lagoa, the next morning Lauren and I walked to the natural pools, ??name??. Looking back towards the beach covered in people the ocean rockpools were far quieter and more relaxing. We sat in the sun and jumped from the rocks into the water to cool down.

That afternoon after another sequencia de camerones at a restaurant overlooking the beach we were picked up by Rodrigo's sister Andrea and her daughter Bianca. We had organised to spend a few days staying with their family in their beachside holiday apartment in the north of Florianópolis. Bianca spoke fluent English which was very helpful when we got stuck but before long the whole family was trying to learn English, especially their dad Carlos, who did impressively well. They taught us some basic Portuguese and together we communicated fine. In was such a nice change to be in a beautiful clean house, with our own bedroom

"Mi casa es tu casa"??

It was great to get the opportunity to see more of the local spots and experience much more than we would have been able to on our own.

## Paraty

Bus to Paraty ended up taking 26 hours. Very slow trip. Ongoing Brazilian trend once everyone is asleep to stop the bus and get everyone off at 3am for a 45 minute restaurant break.

Gloomy weather. First day in Paraty spent exploring the town. Colonial buildings. Struggling over the rugged cobblestone streets throughout the town.

Boat trip around the bay stopping at small tropical beaches. Agua Azul, lulas beach?  Pirate ship style boat. Swimming off the side.

## Ihla Grande

Bus and boat across to Ihla grande. Info??
Checked into our hostel and found a taxi boat to take us to a nearby beach. Dropped us in a quiet calm bay with palm trees lining the shore. Blue water. Walked through the bush at the back of the forest to ??? Beach on the southern side of the island. Exposed to the ocean. Waves.

Day boat tour lagoa Azul, lagoa verde, two beaches.

Dessert carts, hippies, music.

## Rio de Janeiro

Boat back to the mainland and a van up to Rio. First staying in Ipanema for 2 nights. Spent the first afternoon at the beach. Rented an umbrella and beach chairs. Bars, salesman, even a generator powering beach wifi. Some cheap replacement sunglasses from one of the many vendors. My good sunglasses from home have done me well over the whole trip but are now too scratched to see out of.

Night street party along the beachfront. Everywhere you looked was someone with an eski selling cold beers so you could just buy them as you walked along. Thousands of young people. Found the band towards the end of the party. Danced.

Daily acai bowls with fruit and granola. Info?? Cheap, filling, refreshing, and healthy??

Sugarloaf mountain

Churrascaria. Amazing. Buffet plus meat sticks.

Lapa steps.

Moved hostels to cococabana beach. Late afternoon spent at the beach. Sat on the sand drinking beer and coconuts and reading until 8pm.

## Arraial de Cabo

Extended meant that not only could we be in rio for Carnaval but we got to go up north for 6 days and relax on the beaches of Arraial de Cabo and Buzios. We weren't yet ready to go home.

## Búzios

## Carnaval

Blocos

Sambadrome

Starting in Japan and now finishing in Brazil, I've been in serious denial about coming home for the last few weeks but after 13 months since my last day of work it is unfortunately time. Looking forward to catching up with everyone... after a casual 53 hour journey home
